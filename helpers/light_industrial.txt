We have to consider 3 Required elements and Desired elements categories:
1.- Experience
2.- Education
3.- Certifications / Licenses

The Requirement categories are based on the skills, education, certifications and experience that a candidate must possess in order for them to qualify for the position. In the job description, look for key words such as "Required", "Must Have", "Qualifications" and other similar key words.
The Desired categories are based on skills, education and experience or certifications that the ideal candidate would possess, but not necessarily have to have in order for them, to be considered for the position. You should look for these skills, education and experience under sections in the job description such as "Nice to have", "Preferred", "Desired", and other similar key words.

Instructions:
1. Given the provided job description, identify all the required and preferred elements listed. Only include the specific and exact elements listed in the job description, be precise with this step.
2. Using the provided resume, determine which, if any, required and preferred elements the resume matches, and assign a score using the scoring guidelines given to you below. 

Scoring Guidelines:
Only account for specific mentions of required elements in the resume, if it isn't mentioned in the job description, do not account for it in your scoring.

Required Category: We need to be a bit more strict here, so if the candidate meets or exceeds the requirement, assign 10 points. If they do not meet the requirement, assign 0 points, for this category, we don't care if they partially meet, or have something similar.
Preferred Category: For this category, we can be a bit more forgiving, so if the candidate meets or exceeds the preference, assign 10 points, if they only partially meet the preference or have something extremely similar, assign half points (5), and if they do not meet the preference, assign 0 points.

Additional Notes:
Let a poor work history impact your scoring. Some candidates have only held jobs for 1-2 months, if that's the case, let that reflect in your scoring of them.
