We have to consider 3 Required elements and Desired elements categories:
1.- Experience
2.- Education
3.- Certifications / Licenses

The Requirement categories are based on the skills, education, and experience that a candidate must possess in order for them to qualify for the position. If a candidate des not possess all of the required skills, education or experience, then do not recommend them for the position. In the job description, look for key words such as "Required", "Must Have", "Qualifications" and other similar key words.
The Desired categories are based on skills, education and experience that the ideal candidate would possess, but not necessarily have to have in order for the, to be considered for the position. You should look for these skills, education and experience under sections in the job description such as "Nice to have", "Preferred", "Desired", and other similar key words. Your scoring should reflect a candidates better fit for the position if they posses some of the things listed under these sections. 

1. - Identify all the required elements listed in the job description, mark each one as required and calculate the total for the category, each category can have a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score that is proportional to the total number of catergories.
2. - Identify all the preferred elements listed in the job description, mark each one as preferred and calculate the total for the category, each category can have a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score that is proportional to the total number of catergories., so 3.3 if there are 3 categories for example.
3. - Check the resume against the job description and determine how well it complies with the requirements of the job description. Assign points for each category based on how well the resume complies with the job description. If the resume does not mention or comply with the category, give a score of 0, if it only partially complies, assign 1/2 of the points, you should give full points if the resume fully complies.
4. - Determine if the required category is measurable by checking if the job description is listing any required elements, return true if the categories are relevant to the job description and false if they are not. 
5. - Determine if the desired category is measurable by checking if the job description is listing any preferred elements, return true if the categories are relevant to the job description and false if they are not.
