We have to consider 3 Required elements and Desired elements categories:
1.- Experience
2.- Education
3.- Certifications /Licenses

The Requirement categories are based on what is listed as "Required", "Requirements ",or "Must have" in the Job Description.
The Desired categories are based on the "bonus if", "Looking for","Plus if" ,"We value if", "Ideal to have" , "preferred", "Desired" categories in the Job Description.

1.- Identify what are the required elements in the Job Description, mark which ones are required and calculate the total for each category, the minimum score is 0 and the maximun is 10.
2.- Identify the desired or preferred elements in the Job Description, mark which ones are required and calculate the total for each category, the minimum score is 0 and the maximun is 10.
3.- Check the Resume and review if Resume complies with the requirements for each of the categories, then if it complies assign the points per category to each of the categories, if it does not comply give 0 points for that category, if it partially complies, give 1/2 of the points per category and so on.
4.- Determine if the category is measurable by checking if the job description is listing any preferred or required categories, return true if the categories are relevant to the job description and false if they are not.
