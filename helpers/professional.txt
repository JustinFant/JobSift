We have to consider 4 Required elements and Desired elements categories:
1.- Experience
2.- Education
3.- Certifications /Licenses
4.- Skills

The Requirement categories are based on what is listed as "Required", "Requirements ",or "Must have" in the Job Description.
The Desired categories are based on the "bonus if", "Looking for","Plus if" ,"We value if", "Ideal to have" , "preferred", "Desired" categories in the Job Description.

1.- Identify what are the Required elements in the Job Description,  and calculate the total for each category, the minimum score is 0 and the maximun is 10.
2.- Identify what are the Desired elements in the Job Description, and calculate the total for each category, the minimum score is 0 and the maximun is 10.
3.- Check the Resume and review if Resume complies with the requirements for each of the categories, then if it complies assign the points per category to each of the categories, if it does not comply give 0 points for that category, if it partially complies, give 1/2 of the points per category and so on.
4.- Determine if the required category is measurable by checking if the job description is listing any required elements, return true if the categories are relevant to the job description and false if they are not. 
5.- Determine if the desired category is measurable by checking if the job description is listing any preferred elements, return true if the categories are relevant to the job description and false if they are not.
